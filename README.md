# The Gruv

Welcome to **The Gruv**, a next-generation, AI-native platform designed for creating low-latency, highly-responsive user experiences and powering high-throughput semantic search.

## About

This repository contains the source code for all microservices and components that make up The Gruv platform. The architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and event-driven, allowing for independent development and deployment of each service.

## Architecture Overview

The platform is built on a microservices architecture, with each service communicating asynchronously through a message broker. The key components include:

- **API Gateway**: The single entry point for all client requests.
- **User Service**: Manages user authentication, profiles, and sessions.
- **Real-time Service**: Handles WebSocket connections for real-time communication.
- **Vector Database Service**: Provides an interface for semantic search and vector embeddings.
- **Content Ingestion Service**: Processes and indexes content for search.

## Getting Started

*(This section will be updated with instructions on how to build, test, and run the project locally.)*
